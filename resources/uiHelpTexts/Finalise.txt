A tab to export certain parts to the mod, or export everything, overwriting the whole mod.
**If you can't export, you are missing previous steps, such as strategic regions or country details (in the country tab)**
DO NOT CLOSE THIS PROGRAM DIRECTLY AFTER EXPORTING!
FAQ:
- If it crashes directly at the start, at the second "loading databases", this is likely a bug with strategic regions. KEEP GENERATING STRATEGIC REGIONS in the tab until it works. It should at some point, but no guarantees.
- If it crashes later, ensure you have the debug mode on!
- Also enable crash_data_log as a launch option. Check the modding wikis for more general info on modding.
- Please read the documentation!
- You can find help regarding this tool in the discord channel:  https://discord.gg/m85TndzufD
- If you want to play the generated random mods and have things happening, you NEED to install better generic focus tree mods. I also recommend a better ai mod!
