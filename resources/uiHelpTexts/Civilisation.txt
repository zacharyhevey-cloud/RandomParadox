Civilisation: Here you can generate and edit development and population in multiple sub-tabs|
- Topography: Load in areas such as wasteland (Input colour is rgb 40, 255, 40 )  and marsh (Input colour is rgb 255, 0, 0).
- Development: Affects industrialisation and cities. Generate randomly, or load an image. 
 - Generate Development with new random base development modifiers: Randomly sets a modifier per continent, then applies habitability and other factors on top to calculate the development of a province.
 - Generate Development with current base development modifiers: Randomly sets a modifier per continent, then applies habitability and other factors on top to calculate the development of a province. You may modify the development modifier of a continent, by clicking it on the map and settings it modifier at the bottom of the tab.
- Population: Affects population amount and city size. Generate randomly, or load an image.
- Cultures: Cultures define the languages and the people of an area. 
 They are used to generate names for countries, states, characters etc. 
 You may currently only change the nameset used for random name generation by clicking on a culture colour in the image, and then on edit language.
 Culture loading will follow.
- Locations: Affects world map look and scenario modules make use of this data.
** Do not forget that you can find the autogenerated development and population map in the "Maps/world" folder next to the executable, in case you want to modify them and then load them back in again.**
