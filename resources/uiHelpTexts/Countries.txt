A tab to generate, load, and edit countries.
Loading is done by dragging in an image of unique colours, which represent a country each. You can also load in a list of countries as a text file, to already define names, tags and colours, and then drag in the country image. For this, the country in the text file must have the format r;g;b;tag;name;adjective, see inputs//countryMappings.txt as an example.
You can also export the current state to the Maps//areas folder, for safekeeping. This is also a good basis for editing this list, as it gives you the already existing colours and tags already in a list in the right format.

You can also edit the countries and states by clicking on them in the image, I RECOMMEND EXPORTING THE MOD FIRST, as crashes can occur here, there is always the chance to edit the state and country files manually!.
With the Draw Borders checkbox checked, you can also distribute regions to the currently selected country.

This tab also allows inputting in two different forms, similar to the areas. 
Recommendation: It is often beneficial to use a two step process: First use the border input, drag in a border image. This will have islands etc as their own countries. 
However, the exported countries.png in the Maps/areas folder will contain a solid colour country image. Edit this using the "bucket fill tool" of common image editors, then switch to the solid mode and load this new image, having distributed land bodies however you like.


** Do not forget that you can find the autogenerated countries map countries_no_borders.png in the "Maps" folder next to the executable, in case you want to modify them and then load them back in again.**
