Load or generate the world humidity, white means humid and black means dry. Modify the overall humidity of the world with the Base humidity option.
Humidity is a major factor for climate generation. If you don't want to handle climate zones in detail, you can simply drop in a humidity map and generate climate classification based on it.
If you check Apply elevation effect when loading, the elevation will have an influence on the humidity. This allows to input a more simple map while still getting the detailed output that elevation produces.
