Here you can configure province generation and generate provinces until you are happy with the result. You can also load a province map, by dragging in the province map image you want to use. In case the generated province map is not quite what you want, you can find it in the Maps// folder, edit it with your favourite image editor, and then drag it in.
Here you can configure province generation and generate provinces until you are happy with the result, or load a province map. Most important factors are:

    - Landprovincefactor: The higher, the more provinces on land
    - Seaprovincefactor: The higher, the more provinces on oceans
    - Density Effects: The higher, the more the density map influences density and size of provinces
    - Minimum size of provinces: The higher, the more pixels a province will have
    - Maximum amount of provinces: An upper limit to province amount, increasing this drastically can have major effects on the generated game modules. For Hearts of Iron IV, this upper limit should not be larger than 20000, otherwise visual bugs start to appear!
	
	
The tabs SuperSegments, Segments and Provinces allow two different types of input.
- Solid colour input with or without black (rgb 0,0,0) borders: These black borders are ignored and filled, they do not constitute an area. Having borders first helps creating a solid colour input image.
- Borders: This can be activated by clicking on the Borders input type radio button. Here, this loads anything that is between borders and coasts as an area. Using the Generate supersegment/segment/province template to draw in button, you can get three different templates in the Maps/areas folder of the tool. When you draw in these, you can create simple black (rgb 0,0,0) borders, which will be supersegment/segment/provinces borders.
This whole process allows you to craft very detailed country/state/province borders in a multi step process, as the tempaltes area based on each other. E.g. when you have finished drawing the supersegment borders and have loaded them, you can then generate a segment template that already has these borders in them, to craft your segment/state borders in there, load it, and proceed to provinces.

You may stop this process after every step, and use the default generation!
