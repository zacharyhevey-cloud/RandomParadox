A tab to generate strategic regions.
Increasing the factor increases the amount of strategic regions.
	
This tab also allows inputting in two different forms, similar to the areas. There is one key difference in the Borders input.
- Solid colour input with or without black (rgb 0,0,0) borders: These black borders are ignored and filled, they do not constitute an area. Having borders first helps creating a solid colour input image.
- Borders: This can be activated by clicking on the Borders input type radio button. Here, this loads anything that is between borders and coasts as an area. Using the Generate supersegment/segment/province template to draw in button, you can get three different templates in the Maps/areas folder of the tool. When you draw in these, you can create simple black (rgb 0,0,0) borders, which will be supersegment/segment/provinces borders.
This whole process allows you to craft very detailed country/state/province borders in a multi step process, as the templates area based on each other. E.g. when you have finished drawing the supersegment borders and have loaded them, you can then generate a segment template that already has these borders in them, to craft your segment/state borders in there, load it, and proceed to provinces.
One key difference: White borders are in the template, they are ignored in the image. Coasts do not count as borders!!! You need to instead draw lines there as well. This is because strategic regions often contain small waterbodies or islands.

You may stop this process after every step, and use the default generation!
